		<h3>When the lights are the brightest, five MLB stars have a legacy of coming up clutch.</h3>
	</div>
	<p>The MLB has a regular season where teams play 162 game schedules <span class="highlight1">spanning from April through September</span>.  Sometimes the regular season even creeps into the months of March and October.  In the six months of the season lots of baseball if played and it is difficult for many fans to watch every game that their favorite teams play.  Throughout the dog days of summer the external pressure placed on professional baseball players sometimes lacks, <span class="callout">but that all changes in October.</span></p>
	<p>When the calendar flips to the postseason on the baseball season only <span class="callout">1/3</span> of the teams qualify to keep playing.  Each league, the American League (AL) and National League (NL), have three rounds before the champions meet in the World Series.  There is a one game Wild Card playoff, a best of five division series and a best of seven championship series before the best of seven World Series. </p>
	<p>Andrew Miller had a near perfect 2016 playoff run with the Cleveland Indians where he dominated the Red Sox and Blue Jays to help his team advance to the World Series against the Chicago Cubs.  Miller struck out <class="link"><a class="story-link" href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17923132/andrew-miller-cleveland-indians-sets-postseason-strikeouts-record">30 hitters</a> in the 2016 postseason, <span class="callout">a record for a relief pitcher in a single postseason</span>.  With his fastball in the upper 90s and his <span class="highlight1">knee buckling slider</span> he has shown his superiority over some of the best hitters in the game drawing comparisons to Mariano Rivera.
	</p>
	<p>Millerâ€™s emergence in the 2016 is comparable to other modern day baseball stars such as Rivera, Madison Bumgarner, David Ortiz and Carlos Beltran who all consistently step up and dominate when the pressure rises.</p>
	<p>It gets a little bit difficult to compare these five players solely based on their numbers because two players are hitters, two are relief pitchers and one is a starting pitcher.  One way to compare the players is by comparing their teams <span class="highlight1">win percentages</span> when they play in the game.</p>
		<div class="players">
			<div class="map-wrap">
				<img src="img/Chart.JPG" style="width: 400px;height:300px"></img>
			</div>
			<p>Miller and Rivera may have higher win percentages due to their roles as relief pitchers and closers for their respective teams however they pitch with the game on the line when they sometimes are only holding a one run lead.  As a starter, Bumgarner has found ways to shut down opposing lineups so that all his team needs to do is score one run for the victory.  Ortiz and Beltran both played huge roles in most of their teams postseason victories coming through with clutch hits to carry the respective offenses.</p>	
			<h3>A Breakdown of Each Players Postseason History</h3>
			<h4>David Ortiz (85 Postseason Games)</h4>
			<p> Ortiz will go down as not only one of the greatest players of all time but also a postseason master. Truly a generational talent, Ortiz seemingly always came up clutch for the Red Sox no matter the stage.</p>
			<p>While he did make the postseason with the Minnesota Twins, he did not really begin to crush his opponents until he was a member of the Red Sox.</p>
			<p>The Red Sox traded for Oritz in 2003 when he was seemingly a player that was not going to live up to his hype.  In 2003 the Red Sox made the playoffs and won the American League Divison Series (ALDS) in a five game series.  Ortiz had the go ahead two run, two out double in the bottom of the eighth inning of game four giving the Red Sox a 5-4 lead that they would hold onto in a win or go home game.  The Sox would lose to Mariano Rivera and the rival Yankees in a hard fought seven game American League Championship Series (ALCS).</p>
			<p>The Red Sox made it back to the ALDS in 2004 with a matchup against the Angels.  In game three of the series Ortiz hit a walk-off home run in the 10th inning to win the series and send the Red Sox to the ALCS.</p>
			<p>The ALCS was a rematch between the dynasty of the Yankees v. the "cursed" Red Sox who hadn't won the World Series since 1918.  The Yankees took a 3-0 lead and it seemed like the Red Sox would have to wait another year to break the curse.  <span class="callout">Then Ortiz became a legend.</span></p> 
			</div>
			<div class="map-wrap-2">
				<img src="img/Ortiz2.jpg"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<p>In game four, Ortiz hit a walk-off homerun in the 12th inning, which he followed up with a walk-off single in the 14th inning of game five.  For the series Ortiz had 11 RBIs and a .387 batting average which earned him the ALCS MVP.</p>
			<p>The Red Sox would go on to sweep the Cardinals in the World Series to effectively break the <span class="callout">"Curse of the Bambino".</span>  For the entire postseason, Ortiz hit .409 with 23 RBIs.</p>
			<p>Ortiz led the Red Sox back to the postseason in '05, '07-'09, '13 and'16.  The team would pick up two more World Series titles in '07 and '13 respectively.  Despite all of his heroics in '04 the '13 playoffs may have been the most impressive stretch in the career of Ortiz.</p>
			<p>After the Boston Bombings earlier in the year Ortiz took the field and gave an emotional speech rallying the city of Boston around the team.  In October Ortiz hit an impressive .353 with 5 home runs and 13 RBIs, including a game-tying grand slam in the bottom of the eigth in the ALCS game two, but he took his game to another level in the World Series.</p>
			<p>In the World Series Ortiz hit .688 in a sport where you are considered successful if you hit .300.  He hit two homeruns, had six RBI's and was walked eight times in the six game series on his way to picking up the World Series MVP.  <span class="highlight1">Ortiz seemingly would not be denied</span> as he brought joy back to Boston after a tough year.</p>
			<p>Ortiz played in 85 postseason games hitting .289 with 17 homeruns, two MVP awards and three World Series rings.  In three World Series appearances and 14 games he hit .455 with three homeruns. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="map-wrap-3">
				<img src="img/Beltran2.jpg"</img>				
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<h4>Carlos Beltran (55 Postseason Games)</h4>
			<p>Beltran has played in the postseason with five different teams in his career. He has made most of his postseason appearances in the National League with the Astros, Mets and Cardinals but has also made the postseason with the Yankees in '15 and Rangers in '16.</p>
			<p>For his career Beltran is a .323 postseason hitter with 16 homeruns.</p>
			<p>In two seasons with the Cardinals, beltran led the team to the World Series in back to back years.</p>
			<p>Beltran hasn't put up the flashy numbers in any postseason series throughout his career but he has always been a key contributor to his teams successes and failures.</p>
			<p>By '13 Beltran had already grown a reputation as being on of the most underrated yet consistent postseason performers of the modern ear of the MLB.  After he led the Cardinals to a National League Championship Series (NLCS) victory in six games, a showdown was set up for him and Ortiz in the Fall Classic.</p>
			<P>Unfortunately for Beltran and baseball fans he injured his ribs while crashing into the short right field wall at Fenway Park and played the rest of the series with the injury.</P>
			<p>Beltran has not one a postseason MVP award, or a World Series ring to this point in his career, but what he does bring is a reputation of consistent hitting from both sides of the plate and leadership qualities that are hard to quantify.  When Beltran was younger he also brought valuable speed and defense to his teams through their postseason pushes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="map-wrap-4">
				<img src="img/Bumgarner2.jpg"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<h4>Madison Bumgarner (16 Postseason Games as a pitcher, one as a pinch hitter)</h4>
			<p>Bumgarner has appeared in 4 postseasons throughout his career and his team has lost only one series (the 2016 NLDS to the World Series champion Chicago Cubs).  With the San Francisco Giants, Bumgarner has been a part of 11 series victories and three World Series teams.</p>
			<p>Bumgarner has been masterful throughout most of his postseason career, being the winning pitcher in two win or go home Wild Card games.  </p>
			<p>For his career, Bumgarner has pitched in 16 games starting 14 of them.  He has tallied a 8-3 record, good for a .727 winning percentage, and has pitched to an ERA of 2.11. </p>
			<p>While his postseason career numbers are impressive in their own right, what he did for his team in the '14 postseason was nothing short of spectacular.</p>
			<p>After failing to win the divisional crown in the regular season the Giants were set to face the Pirates at PNC Park in Pittsburh in the one game playoff.  While many players may have been fazed going into such a difficult ballpark Bumgarner responded by throwing a four hit shutout with 10 strikeouts to lead his team to the NLDS.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="map-wrap-8">
				<img src="img/pie.JPG" style="width: 250px;height:200px"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<p>Bumgarner continued his road dominance in the NLCS against the Cardinals when he threw 7 2/3 scoreless innings in the opening game to set an <span class="callout">MLB record for most consecutive socreless innings pitched on the road</span> with 26 2/3.  With his two starts in the series, both in Giants wins, Bumgarner was named the NLCS MVP.</p>
			<p>As if his performance in the championship series wasn't enough Bumgarner was unbeatable in the World Series.  After starting games one and five, collecting wins in both games Bumgarner appeared in game seven on short rest and collected the save for the Giants as he locked up their third World Series title since '10.  For the series Bumgarner went 2-0, with one save, 21 innings pitched, only nine hits allowed and an ERA of 0.43 on his way to the World Series MVP.</p>
			<p>Bumgarner has been an All-Star caliber pitcher in the regular season, however he has earned the postseason reputation of being on the shortlist of pitchers the opposition does not want to see take the mound.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="map-wrap-5">
				<img src="img/Rivera2.jpg" style="width: 200px;height:266px"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<h4>Mariano Rivera (96 Postseason Games)</h4>
			<p>Rivera will go down in history as being the best closer of his era as well as one of the most dominant pitchers of all time.  Despite being a one pitch pitcher, Rivera proved that he could make his one pitch almost unhittable.</p>
			<p>In 1995, when Rivera made his postseason debut, he was not only used as a closer.  He was simply a dominant reliever, who could enter the game at any time and shut down an opposing lineup.</p>
			<p>Pitching on the Yankees certainly allowed Rivera the opportunity to reach the postseason, as he appeared in every postseason from 1995 through 2007, as well as 2009 through 2011.  In those 16 years he pitched in 96 postseason games, finishing a miraculous 78 of them, accounting for 141 innings pitched.  Yankee fans felt nothing but confidence with Rivera on the mound.</p>
			<p>Rivera went to seven World Series with the Yankees and was a member of five championship winning teams.</p>
			<p>Some people out there argue that relievers are not as valuable to a teams success or failure as a starter, or a hitter, but in his 141 postseason innings Rivera was a definite game changer.  He was in the game when the pressures were the highest, being asked to get the biggest outs with little to no margin of error.</p>
			<p>Rivera did have his share of postseason hiccups, the game seven walk off single by Luis Gonzalez to give the Diamondbacks the '01 series and many close calls against the Red Sox in the ALCS.  For all the hiccups there were even more successes.</p>
			<p>For his career, Rivera had a postseason ERA of 0.70.  He was 8-1 with 42 saves when the game was on the line.  Rivera faced 527 batters in his postseason career, allowing just two home runs.  Rivera was also the recipient of the 1999 World Series MVP and the 2003 ALCS MVP for his dominating performances.</p>
			<p>Rivera was the guy in the bullpen for the Yankees, before the game began to have teams with dominant bullpens.  His abiility to shorten a game was <span class="callout">second to none,</span> as more likely than not when his cutter was on the hitters had no chance.</p>
			</div>
				<div class="map-wrap-6">
				<img src="img/Miller2.jpg" style="width: 150px;height:200px"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<h4>Andrew Miller (16 Postseason Games)</h4>
			<p>Miller dominated the Red Sox and Blue Jays, in the ALDS and ALCS respectively, during his historic postseason run.  In an era where teams place an emphasis on having a shut down bullpen, Miller proved to be an important weapon for his team.</p>
			<p>What made Miller so spectacular was not only the stuff that he brought with him to the mound, but also his ability to fill any role his team asked of him.</p>
			<p>Miller was able to come into the game in the sixth inning of games, and bridge the gap until the Indians were able to get to closer Cody Allen.  However, he was also able to close out games if his manager, Terry Francona thought that the matchups were better.</p>
			<p>Game after game, inning after inning and batter after batter Miller would come in and shut down the opposition.  Red Sox and Blue Jays hitters, who are familiar with Miller as he has pitched for three AL East teams in his career: the Red Sox, Orioles and Yankees, were unable to even make contact as Miller went on to set the strikeout record.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately for Miller and the Indians, they ran into the team of destiny of the Cubs who won the 2016 World Series in a seven game classic, but that did not stop Miller from having one of the most memorable postseason stretches in major league history.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="map-wrap-7">
				<img src="img/miller.gif" style="width: 150px;height:75px"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="players">
			<p>In the ALDS and ALCS Miller threw a combined 11.2 innings facing 41 batters.  Of those 41 batter miller struck out 21 and gave up just five hits.</p>
			<p>These two series exhibited domiantion smiliar to the likes of Rivera, and showed Miller's true postseason value.</p>
			<p>At the end of the 2016 postseason Miller had a career postseason ERA of 0.98 in 27 2/3 innings.  Having faced an even 100 batters in his postseason career, Miller has only surrendered 13 hits (seven of which came against 32 batters in the 2016 World Series).</p>
			<p>2016 was not Miller's first experience to the postseason as he also made it in 2014 with the Orioles and 2015 with the Yankees.  In '14 and '16 Miller was a trade deadline acquisition for his new team, with the knowledge that he could be a dominant postseason difference maker.</p>

		<p>All five of these players have proven track records showing that they can compete with the best of the best when external pressures increase.  Between them are postseason awards tallying  <span class="highlight1">11 World Series rings, three chamionship MVP's and three World Series MVP's</span>, all between the years 1996-2016.</p>
		<p>There are have been many great postseason performances in the history of the MLB, and these five modern era players are amoung <span class="callout">the greatest performers when the bright lights come on.</span></p>
